title: 'Creating Your First NLU Model'
---

In this guide, we'll show you how to create your first NLU model using NL Studio, which you can use to improve your chatbot.

## Login to Kata Platform

Before we start, make sure that you're logged in to the Kata Platform. Go to [platform.kata.ai/login](https://platform.kata.ai/login) and type in your credentials.

## Designing Entities

Before creating a NLU, you need to find out what things we would like to capture from the user. We'll map these into entities, which you'll create in the NL Studio. You want to have just enough entities so that you have everything you need from the user, but not too much that you have to train using more data.

In the context of our Pizza Bot, we would like to capture the following:

- The _type_ of the pizza.
- The _size_ of the pizza.
- The kind of _crust_ the pizza will have.
- The _quantity_ of pizzas to order.

We will go into what entity type we'll use for each one of them in the next section.
