## Bot Studio improvements

- We've added the Quickreply and Confirm Template action templates, compatible for LINE Messenger.
- Buttons can now be used to trigger a date/time picker.
- Added the option to add Phrase NLU output for NLU entities with type Phrase.

## Deprecated NLU Types

On the Bot Studio NLU selector, we have deprecated NLU types `Verstand classifier`, `Verstand tagger` and `Verstand retrieval`. New NLUs created can no longer have these types.

## Bug fixes

- **Bot Studio:** Fixed incorrect KataML generated when creating CMS action.
- **Bot Studio:** Fixed issue where onEnter mapping is stringified.
- **NL Studio:** Fixed unable to inherit NLU.
- **NL Studio:** Fixed searching inherit and root NLU.
- **NL Studio:** Fixed various display issues with training + prediction log.
