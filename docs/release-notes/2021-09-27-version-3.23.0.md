## What's New ‚≠êÔ∏è

We develop a lot of improvements for the Kata Platform in user experience and the newest action types for your bot, here is the list:

-   We‚Äôve changed the **captcha validation** into the most powerful and secure captcha: hCaptcha. Please upgrade your KataCLI version to the 2.7.1 version too.
-   The wait is over üéâ You can **remove team admin or remove team members** if they are no longer involved in the project. You may **add more admin** in 1 project. These abilities are for team admin only.
-   Yes, we heard you. We launched 2 newest action types for the WhatsApp bot: **List Messages** and **Reply Button**. You can create a less-typing experience through your end-users and get more engagement with it. Learn more about [List Messages](https://docs.kata.ai/channels/whatsapp/#-new--list-message) and [Reply Button](https://docs.kata.ai/channels/whatsapp/#-new--reply-button).
-   Now, you can add an image with a caption for your WhatsApp bot. Learn more about [the caption](https://docs.kata.ai/channels/whatsapp/#image-and-image-with-caption).
