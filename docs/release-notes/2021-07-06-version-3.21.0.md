## What's New

If you're a user who trains natural language models with large amount of data on KataCLI, but don't know where you can see the results of the data training, this feature is suitable for you!

**We're adding NL bulk training on the GUI,** so you can easily upload your training data (up to 200 sentences/lines) and directly see the results on the same GUI. Learn more about [NL bulk training in GUI](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nl-bulk-training).

## What's been fixed

Improved training speed for shorter retraining time

## Wait, what is retraining?

When doing training for the NL models, you may incorrectly put a tag and prompt an automatic training for the tag. In that case, you can delete the incorrect sentence and the system will perform the _retraining_ process to all your NL models using the updated training data.
