Kata Platform provides several technologies to help you build your chatbot better and get it to production quickly.

## Kata Markup Language (KataML)

Developing a simple chatbot is easy, but how do you scale with ever growing features and capabilities? To answer that we developed **KataML**, a YAML based markup language tailored for bot builders. Writing your bots in KataML allows you to focus on the user experience instead of the code structure, and you will less likely to produce spaghetti code while growing your bot capabilities. KataML also let you embed javascript code in case you need more powerful scripting capability.

You can read the KataML specification [here](/kata-ml/overview/).

## Kata CLI

Meet your devops assistant: **Kata CLI**. If you are a developer and already using git or heroku, you will be familiar with Kata CLI. With the CLI, you can easily deploy, update and integrate your bots. Just type the appropriate command in the terminal.

## Automated Testing

The Bot Platform includes a YAML based testing framework for developers and QA to easily write automated testing. With this, you can ensure the robustness of the bot you built.
